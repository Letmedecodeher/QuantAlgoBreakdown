# 🧠 Quantum Teleportation: Transferring a Qubit Without Moving It

This repository contains an educational tutorial on **Quantum Teleportation**, created as part of a quantum algorithm implementation challenge. The goal is to help learners understand the **theory**, **mathematics**, and **practical implementation** of quantum teleportation using Qiskit.

## 📋 Table of Contents


## 📌 Introduction

Quantum teleportation is a protocol that allows the transfer of an unknown quantum state from one qubit to another — without physically moving the particle — using **entanglement** and **classical communication**.

This tutorial explains the protocol step by step and demonstrates how to build and simulate it using Qiskit.
